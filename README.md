# âœ¨ Spigot Plugin Template
A Spigot template that I use for Spigot plugin development! This includes the API, bStats, and the shading configuration. Sometimes JARs also need to be added in case NMS is required.

To build, simply run:
```
mvn package
```

The JAR will get exported directly into the server folder, making testing a breeze.
